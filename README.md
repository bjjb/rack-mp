# MP

Memory profiler for Rack apps (on Ruby 2)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'mp'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mp

## Usage

Mount MP as a middleware.

Visit a path with `__mp__=counts` somewhere in the query string.

Check the response headers for `X-MP-ObjectCounts`.


## TODO

* Make the header smaller (serialize to "OBJNAME:N1:N2,...", for example)
* Use Ruby 2.1's excellent objspace library to do full object profiling, and
  serve beautiful graphs and whatnot. Ma√±ana.
